# ElevateLabs-Task-8

1. I started by selecting and signing up for ProtonVPN, a well regarded free VPN service.
2. I then followed the official ProtonVPN instructions for Debian based systems. This involved adding their repository and installing the client using command line tools on my Kali Linux environment.
3. Once installed, I launched the client and connected to a VPN server.
4. After connecting, I checked if my public IP address had successfully changed.
5. I browsed a few websites to ensure my internet traffic was routing correctly through the VPN.
6. After my test, I disconnected from the VPN. I checked my IP address again to confirm it reverted to my original one and also compared the browsing speed.
7. I then spent time researching the core concepts of VPNs, focusing on their encryption methods (like AES 256) and privacy features (no logs policy).
8. After using VPN I was able to confirm that the browsing speed is better when there is no VPN, because your connection is not going directly to the destination.

    Benefit - The main benefit is privacy. A VPN encrypts your connection and hides your real IP address which stops the hackers from seeing your online activity.
    Limitation - The most noticeable limitation is a reduction in internet speed, as your traffic is being encrypted and sent through an extra server.
